/* Linked List An intro-
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts: Data and Node*/
//let us create a linked list of three nodes and print their values

#include<stdlib.h>

{
    int data;

    {

        scanf("%d",&newnode->data);
